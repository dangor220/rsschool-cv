## About myself

Postgraduate student of the Moscow Finance and Law University
in the field of information technology and telecommunications.

I began my acquaintance with web development by reading the book "HTML and CSS.
Designing and Creating Websites. Then I gradually began to learn new technologies,
fixing them in practice.

My characteristic traits are tenacity and persistence in achieving the goal:
to solve the problem until the end result. Any work I try to do qualitatively,
responsibly and accurately.

I understand that self-study is not enough and need real practice
and experience with professional web-developers.
Ready to constantly evolve and learn as part of a team.

  const sum = (a, b, c) => a + (b * c);

  const curry = func => curryed = (...args1) => 
    args1.length >= func.length ?
      func.apply(this, args1) :
      pass = (...args2) => curryed.apply(this, args1.concat(args2));

  const curryedSum = curry(sum);

  console.log(curryedSum(3)(2)(2)) // => 7
